Procedure:
    1. Read a txt file sequences  
    2. search coincidences between names 
    3. save mtDNA sequence and y chromosome sequence for each name
    4. Write mtDNA sequences into one file
    5. Write Y chromosome sequences into another file
    
Input: text file with DNA sequences
Output: two fasta files containing mtDNA sequences (mtDNA.fna) and Y chromosome 
        sequences (Ychromosome.fna)
    
Usage: 

    python FastaParser.py text_file output_fasta_file_mtDNA[optional] output_fasta_file_Ychromosome[optional]
